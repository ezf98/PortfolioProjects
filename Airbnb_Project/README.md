# **Airbnb Dataset Analysis**

This project uses a dataset from Airbnb to analyze key metrics such as average prices, yearly revenue, and listings per room. The dataset was cleaned using MySQL and visualized using Tableau.

# **Installation**
To run this project, you will need to have MySQL and Tableau installed on your computer.

# **Methodology**
The Airbnb dataset was cleaned using a series of MySQL queries to remove any duplicate or incomplete data, as well as to standardize the data to ensure consistency. As parcels were repeated, they were used to populate Null Values.

# **Visualizations**
The cleaned dataset was then imported into Tableau, where a number of visualizations were created to analyze the data. Some of the key visualizations include:

- Bar Chart showing Average prices by Zip Code and Average price per Bedroom
- Line chart with Yearly revenue trends
- Listings per room by neighborhood
- Map with Zip Code distribution, line chart with revenue used in the tooltip.

The original files used, the SQL code and the Visualization are all in this folder.
