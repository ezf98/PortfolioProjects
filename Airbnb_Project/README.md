# Airbnb MySQL Project

For this project I use a dataset from Airbnb; I cleaned it with MySQL and then moved it to Tableau to be able to visualize insights such as average prices, yearly revenue and listings per room.

The original files used, the SQL code and the Visualization are all in this folder.
