# Music dataset cleaning with MySQL Project

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle, that has the Spotify Hits from 2000 until 2019. It contained the name of the songs, the artist, genre and music attributes, such as danceability, energy, acusticness, etc.

After cleaning it with MySQL, I created a dashboard in Tableau, were we can see what were the most popular genres, how explicit lyrics in the music decreased in the years, and what are the most common music attributes.

The original files used, the MySQL code and the Tableau dashboard are in this folder.
