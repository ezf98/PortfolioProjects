# Covid MySQL Project

For this project I use two datasets, containing the deaths and vaccines given to the world population; I applied Exploratory Data Analysis with MySQL and then moved it to Tableau. In the dashboard we can see how many deaths per continent and country there were, the total population infected and a global overview of the pandemic.

The original files used, the SQL code and the Visualization are all in this folder.
