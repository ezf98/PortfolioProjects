# **COVID-19 Pandemic Data Analysis**
In this project, I analyzed two datasets containing information on COVID-19 deaths and vaccines administered worldwide. I used MySQL to clean and analyze the data. After cleaning the datasets, I merged them to create a single comprehensive dataset which was later visualized used Tableau.

# **Installation**
To run this project, you will need to have MySQL and Tableau installed on your computer.

# **Methodology**
A series of MySQL queries were used to calculate summary statistics (Total Cases VS Total Deaths, Countries with highest infection rates; as examples) and segment the data by country and continent.

# **Visualization**
I then used Tableau to create a dashboard that presents the insights from the data in an easily digestible format. The dashboard displays the following graphs:

- World Map showing the percent of the population infected by each country
- A bar chart that displays the total deaths per continent
- Line chart displaying the top countries by population infected trough time. 

# **Conclusion**
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's lives across the globe. By analyzing and visualizing data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccines, we can gain insights that help us better understand the pandemic's impact. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pandemic's effect on different regions and populations.
