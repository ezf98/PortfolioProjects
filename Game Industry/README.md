# Games Dataset Cleaning with Python Project

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle, containing the sales and critic's scores for only some of the games. Due to the fact that most of it was empty, I cleaned it using Python, before moving it to Tableau.

In the dashboard, we see the top 20 games by score, what are the sales per platform, who are the best selling developers and games.

The original files used, the Jupyter Notebook and the Visualization are all in this folder.
