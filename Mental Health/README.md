# **Music Preferences and Mental Health Survey**
This project aims to investigate the relationship between music preferences and mental health, by analyzing data collected from a survey. The survey asked participants to report their favorite music genre and their self-reported levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and OCD on a scale of 0-10.

# **Data Cleaning**
The original dataset was cleaned using Python. The cleaning process involved removing missing values with 0 as I didn't wanted to drop the rows, converting the columns to the appropiate data type, and assigning a numerical value to a categorical one, so it could be visualized.

The cleaned data was saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

# **Data Analysis and Visualization**
To analyze the data and create visualizations, I used Power BI. The dashboard provides an overview of the survey results, including the average ratings for each mental health condition by favorite music genre, and the relationship between music and mental health.

The dashboard also includes information on the number of survey takers, the average age, and the average number of hours of music listened per day.

# **Conclusion**
Through this project, we were able to explore the relationship between music preferences and mental health. The results showed that some music genres were associated with higher or lower levels of certain mental health conditions. This information could be useful for individuals seeking to improve their mental health, as well as for music therapists and mental health professionals.
