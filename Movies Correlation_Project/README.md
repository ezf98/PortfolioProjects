# **Movie Data Analysis**
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about movies such as rating, genre, year of release, director, country, budget, and more.

# **Installation**
To run this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer.

# **Data Cleaning**
I used Python's Pandas library to import and clean the data, including removing any missing or incorrect values; data types had to be checked and corrected to facilitate analysis.

# **Data Visualization**
I used Matplotlib to create a scatter plot that displays the correlation between gross earnings and budget. This visualization helps to better understand the relationship between these two variables and how they impact a movie's success. Additionally, I used Seaborn to create a correlation matrix that shows the relationship between all variables in the dataset.

# **Conclusion**
Analyzing movie data can help provide insights into what makes a movie successful. By cleaning and visualizing the data, we can better understand the relationships between different variables and how they impact a movie's success. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the movie dataset, allowing for a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to a movie's success.
