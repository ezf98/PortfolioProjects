# Movies correlation with Python Project

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle, containing relevant info about movies, such as the rating, genre, year of release, director, country, budget, etc. 

Then I cleaned it and made a visualization with Matplotlib to show the correlation between gross earnings and budget; also did a correlation matrix between all variables using Seaborn library.

The original files used and the Jupyter Notebook are in this folder.
