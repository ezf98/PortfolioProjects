# **Spotify Hits Dashboard**
This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify hits from 2000 to 2019. The dataset contains information on the name of the songs, the artist, genre, and various music attributes such as danceability, energy, and acousticness.

# **Data Cleaning**
To prepare the dataset for analysis, MySQL was used for cleaning and filtering the data.

# **Dashboard Creation**
The cleaned dataset was then imported into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard allows users to explore various insights such as the most popular genres, trends in explicit lyrics over the years, and the most common music attributes.
